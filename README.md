# GettingAndCleaningData

This is the repository for my project on the Getting and Cleaning Data course.

It contains 3 R script files:

- variables.R, which contains the main variables used in the project
- summaries_functions.R, which contains the necessary functions for the project
- run_analysis.R, which is the main script performing the necessary tasks to get the right output

These files must be placed on the working directory to work properly.

The "UCI HAR Dataset" folder contains the data sets for the project. This folder must also be placed directly on the working directory.
